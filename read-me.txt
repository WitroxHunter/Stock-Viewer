Thank you for checking out my first cinnamon desklet.
It's a simple ticker viewer to save some time on checking the market.

TO START - Get your API key on finnhub at https://finnhub.io/ and put it into the 6th line of api.js.
Don't use too many tickers, as it will slow down the loading speed (I reccommend using 3-7).
You can change them in tickers.json.

The refresh rate is set for every 5 minutes in desklet.js, 
changing it may cause loading problems as the API has some limits.

If any loading errors appear while you refresh the desklet, its probably due to API limits.
